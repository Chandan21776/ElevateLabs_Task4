Task 4: Feature Encoding & Scaling – Short Description

 Feature Encoding & Scaling focuses on preparing the dataset for machine learning by transforming raw features into numerical and standardized formats. Categorical variables are encoded using label encoding or one-hot encoding based on their nature, while numerical features are scaled using standardization techniques. This task ensures all features contribute equally to model training, improves algorithm performance and makes the dataset fully machine-learning ready.
